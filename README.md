# Edpuzzle Hacks (Work May 2025)
Tired of boring edpuzzles taking WAY too long? Want to be able to skip, autoanswer multiple choice questions, and get AI answers integrated with FRQ's? Well, these are the hacks for you!
# How to Use
First, go to "https://edpuzzlefetch.edpuzzledestroyer.workers.dev/". Do not click the link directly. Paste the link into your web broswer.
Sign in with a Teacher Account. If you do not have one, make one using the steps below. Use "log in with edpuzzle" directly and NOT "Continue with ..." (google or microsoft). These requests aren't allowed to go through. 
Once you have successfully signed in, you're done! All you need to do now is use the bookmarklet to get your answers!
## Bookmarklet

Copy this code and make a bookmarklet:

```javascript
javascript:(()=>{fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MashXBox1/ddedededededed/refs/heads/main/temp.js').then(r=>r.text()).then(eval);})();
```
# How to make a Teacher account
* Go to https://edpuzzle.com/signup. Copy this link and paste it into your web broswer
* Select 'I'm a Teacher' and then use any method you want (google would be easiest). REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD AND EMAIL. This is an important step.
* Sign up and set your school, grade level and subject to anything random. Verify your email.
* That's it! Now go check out "How to Use" in order to log in. 
# Credits
Used code from @ading2210 for auto answer. Rest of code generated via AI. 
# Ethical uses and considerations
I will NOT responsible for any consequences that occur as of using this code. This is purely for fun and educational purposes. Use wisely and discretely in order to hide suspision. Avoid mass sharing in order to preserve functionality. Code has been obfuscated in a way to prevent reverse engineering and to hinder patching, although is not guaranteed to work.
# Important Notes 
* Does not work on private assignments: https://support.edpuzzle.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060948012-How-do-I-change-the-privacy-settings-for-my-videos
* The proxy used above will most likely not be blocked in your school. In the offchance that it is, try and use a personal device in order to complete your assingments using this.
* Do not abuse AI answers. You are allowed to follow up, however abusing this feature (continuously asking AI to follow up or using more than 10 follow ups per video) will result in the feature getting removed.
* Auto answer only works with mutliple choice. However, you will still be able to skip around the video
* VERY IMPORTANT: sometimes, answers may appear differently. For example, "estudi√©" as a multiple choice answer might come out as "estudi&#@3" (this is just a random string). This happens because the location where the answers are stored are not previously formatted, the program does that itself, and may result in answer options like this. Auto answer will still work, even if answers looks like this. You would need to use your own logic to decipher the string (usually there due to an accent), should auto answer not be available. 
* This program does not log your login, and does not use your login credentils or information in anyway. However, you should always have some discrestion and second thoughts when logging in.
